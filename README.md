This is our  Finals Activity for Electives 2 - Machine Learning using Computer Vision for "Facial Detection of Ben&Ben Band Members".

## **Introduction**

**Facial Detection** is referring to the intructions given to a computer or system where an algorithm is used to detect human faces in digital imagges or videos. Compared to the **Facial Recognition**, which identify or name the individual that is detected, whilst **Facial Detection** focuses on detecting presence and location of the faces.

## **Abstract**

This project, titled "**Facial Detection of Ben&Ben Band Members**", focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to automatically detect and recognize the faces of the members of the popular Filipino band, Ben&Ben, in images. The primary goal of the project is to identify faces of the band members in images that is posted online for fan engagement and media production.

The methodology of this Final Activity is to gather images if the Ben&Ben group photos under different conditions i.e. lighting, facial expression, and facial  orientation. The facial detection process utilizes the **Haar** and **LBP Cascade Classifier** algorithm to detect faces in images, identify its location on the image and comparison of the two algorithms. 

The expexted result of this final activity is to create a reliable system for facial detection and compare the two classifier based on performance of facial recognition. **(padagdag ako dito bien)**
